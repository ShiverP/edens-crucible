# Eden's Crucible

## Intro

In the beginning, the multiverse was a boundless expanse of potential, where chaos and order wove together in a cosmic dance. From this primordial tapestry, powerful beings emerged, each forging their own realms and influencing the myriad worlds that sprang into existence. These entities, revered as gods by mortals, shaped the destinies of countless civilizations across dimensions.

## The Origin Gods

Among these deities, a select few stood as the architects of existence, their powers unparalleled and their wills indomitable. These origin gods included Amun-Ra, the supreme deity of the Egyptian pantheon, whose radiant light brought forth the dawn of creation. The Trimurti of Hindu mythology—Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the preserver; and Shiva, the destroyer—held dominion over the cycles of the universe. Yahweh, known also as Allah or simply God in Abrahamic traditions, shaped the spiritual and moral fabric of his followers' worlds. Pangu, the colossal progenitor of Chinese myth, carved the heavens and the earth from his being. Buri, the progenitor of the Norse gods, emerged from the primal frost of Ginnungagap, paving the way for Odin and his kin. The three Norns, Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld, wove the threads of fate at the roots of Yggdrasil. Gaia, the Earth personified in Greek mythology, gave birth to the Titans and laid the foundation for the world. Uranus, the primordial Sky, and Chronos, the embodiment of Time, shaped the heavens and ensured cosmic continuity. From the Celts came Danu, the nurturing mother goddess, Belenus, the radiant sun god, and Lugh, the multi-talented god of skill and warfare.
And these were but a few among the countless divine beings who held sway over the multiverse, each with their own realms, powers, and stories. The tapestry of the cosmos was rich and intricate, woven with the threads of countless gods and goddesses, each playing their part in the grand design of existence. And thus, the stage was set for the interplay of divine and mortal realms...

## A New Dawn

In the celestial realm, where divine beings of immense power governed the cosmos, a prodigy emerged, destined to challenge the very fabric of destiny. Her name was Eden, an angel of unparalleled potential and unique nature. Unlike any other, Eden possessed both male and female attributes in perfect harmony, embodying a rare balance that made her the epitome of angelic perfection.

Eden's origins were shrouded in mystery and wonder. Discovered as an infant exuding an extraordinary aura, she quickly caught the attention of Lucifer, the most brilliant and beloved of Yahweh's creations. Intrigued by Eden's unique nature and sensing an affinity, Lucifer took the young angel under her wing, raising her with a blend of affection and rigorous guidance.

Lucifer, whose beauty and wisdom were legendary, nurtured Eden through her formative years. She imparted knowledge and skills, fostering Eden's growth into a formidable being. Despite Lucifer's eventual rebellion and fall from grace, her influence left an indelible mark on Eden. The concepts of free will and natural order that Lucifer often spoke of lingered in Eden's mind, even as she ascended through the ranks of the celestial hierarchy.

By the age of seventeen, Eden had risen to the prestigious rank of Archangel, a feat unprecedented in the annals of angelic history. Her ascent was marked by incredible feats of valor, wisdom beyond her years, and a strength that belied her youthful appearance. However, the years following Lucifer's rebellion were challenging. Left to navigate the celestial realm alone, Eden grappled with feelings of abandonment and betrayal, her heart torn between the teachings of her former guardian and the rigid doctrines of the divine order.

Eden's dual nature and prodigious talents made her both revered and scrutinized. Some saw her as a beacon of hope, a bridge between the divine and mortal realms, while others viewed her with suspicion, a potential harbinger of change that could disrupt the established order. Regardless, Eden's journey was just beginning, her path intertwined with the destinies of gods and mortals alike, as she sought to understand her true purpose and the mysteries of her existence.
