# Edens-crucible

Developing a story driven RPG with plenty of mythology and sci-fi. 
Eden's story is whatever you wish for it to be. Will you be focused solely on destroying your enemies and fighting your way through the content, or will you be reasoning with everyone, trying to resolve conflicts through communication, understanding and love?

Currently in development:

- Pantheon manager - A program, written in Python, for creating, managing and viewing the characters in the game.
