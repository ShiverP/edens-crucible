# Edens-crucible

An interactive story with plenty of mythology and sci-fi.
 
Playable character named Eden is an angel that basically has their own fall from grace. The player decides exactly how the story goes with an almost exhaustive amount of choices. 

Currently in development:

- Pantheon manager - A program, written in Python, for creating, managing and viewing the deities in the game. Subject to change from being deity and myth oriented to just straight up characters.
- Ren'Py game - Subject to change from Ren'Py to another engine. TwineSC, Unity, etc.
